Challenge
 Problem Statement
In Africa, many students face significant challenges in understanding STEM concepts. Traditional learning methods often fail to captivate their interest, leading to disengagement and hindered academic progress. This is particularly concerning as STEM fields are crucial for the continent's development and innovation.
STEMonIT aims to address this pressing need by providing an engaging and user-friendly platform for STEM education. By leveraging technology and interactive quizzes, STEMonIT seeks to revolutionize the way African students learn and engage with STEM subjects. Through this initiative, we aspire to empower the next generation of African scientists, engineers, and innovators, driving progress and prosperity across the continent.
Intended Users:
STEMonIT targets students and educators at various educational levels who are seeking additional resources and tools for learning and teaching STEM subjects. The platform will cater to users globally, without being specific to any particular locale.
Locale Dependency:
STEMonIT acknowledges the linguistic diversity across Africa while recognizing the current practicality of focusing on English as the primary language for content delivery. As such, the application is designed to be universally accessible, prioritizing English as the language of instruction to ensure widespread reach and ease of use.
Risks
Technical Risks
Frontend Interactivity: Ensuring smooth and responsive user interaction may pose a technical challenge.
User Interface Responsiveness: Designing a user interface that works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.
Non-technical Risks
User Engagement: The success of the application relies on engaging users effectively and keeping them motivated to participate in quizzes.
Usability Issues: Potential difficulties in navigating the platform or understanding quiz instructions could impact user satisfaction.
Content Relevance: Ensuring that quiz questions are relevant and aligned with educational objectives to maintain user interest.

 Infrastructure
Branching and Merging
Since the project is conducted solely by the author, there was no need for branching and merging.

 Deployment Strategy
The deployment process will involve serving static files directly. This approach simplifies deployment by eliminating the need for complex server configurations and database setups.
Data Population
Initial quiz questions will be manually entered into the application. Additionally, provisions will be made for dynamically adding more questions through the frontend interface, thereby catering for the lack of backend involvement in data management.
Testing
Manual testing will be performed to evaluate usability and identify any potential issues or bugs.

Existing Solutions
 Similar Products
Existing platforms such as Khan Academy, Quizizz, and Kahoot offer similar features for interactive learning and quizzes in various subjects, including STEM.
Differentiation
STEMonIT aims to differentiate itself by focusing specifically on STEM education, providing tailored content and quizzes to enhance understanding in these subjects. Unlike some existing platforms that incorporate social features, STEMonIT prioritizes simplicity and educational content.
Reimplementation Justification
While existing solutions offer similar functionality, STEMonIT is developed from scratch to ensure customization for STEM education. By building the platform in-house, I have been able to align the features and content with the specific needs of STEM learners and educators.
