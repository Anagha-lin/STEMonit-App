### 6.0 Infrastructure
**Branching and Merging:**
The team will adopt the Gitflow branching model for managing code changes efficiently. This model provides a clear structure for branching and merging, facilitating collaboration among team members.

**Deployment Strategy:**
The deployment process will involve serving static files directly. This approach simplifies deployment by eliminating the need for complex server configurations and database setups.

**Data Population:**
Initial quiz questions will be manually entered into the application. Additionally, provisions will be made for dynamically adding more questions through the frontend interface, reducing backend involvement in data management.

**Testing:**
Unit tests will be conducted using Jest for frontend components, ensuring the reliability and functionality of the application. Manual testing will also be performed to evaluate usability and identify any potential issues or bugs.

### 7.0 Existing Solutions
**Similar Products:**
Existing platforms such as Khan Academy, Quizizz, and Kahoot offer similar features for interactive learning and quizzes in various subjects, including STEM.

**Differentiation:**
STEMonIT aims to differentiate itself by focusing specifically on STEM education, providing tailored content and quizzes to enhance understanding in these subjects. Unlike some existing platforms that incorporate social features, STEMonIT prioritizes simplicity and educational content.

**Reimplementation Justification:**
While existing solutions offer similar functionality, STEMonIT is developed from scratch to ensure customization for STEM education. By building the platform in-house, the team can better align the features and content with the specific needs of STEM learners and educators.

### Conclusion
STEMonIT is a web application designed to enhance STEM education through interactive quizzes. By providing a user-friendly platform with engaging content, the application aims to make STEM learning fun and accessible to students and educators worldwide. With a focus on simplicity, relevance, and user satisfaction, STEMonIT strives to complement traditional teaching methods and foster a deeper understanding of STEM subjects.

## STEMonIT MVP Specification

### 1.0 Architecture
The architecture of the STEMonIT platform is designed to facilitate seamless interaction between users and quizzes using only Java, HTML, and CSS.

#### 1.1 Components
**Client Side (Frontend):**
The client side, or frontend, of STEMonIT is responsible for rendering the user interface and enabling interaction with the web application. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and Java to create a dynamic and engaging experience for users.

- **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):** Used for structuring the content of web pages, defining the layout and elements such as text, images, and buttons. It provides the foundation for presenting quizzes, educational materials, and navigation controls.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** Employed to style the HTML elements, defining their appearance, layout, and visual effects. This includes aspects such as colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent presentation across different devices.
- **Java:** Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the frontend. It handles user interactions, such as submitting quiz answers, navigating between pages, and fetching quiz data.

### 1.2 Data Flow
The data flow in STEMonIT involves the seamless movement of information between different components within the client side.

**1. User Interaction (Frontend):**
- Users interact with the frontend interface of STEMonIT, where they can access quizzes, educational content, and track their progress.
- User interactions, such as selecting quiz topics, answering questions, and navigating through the application, generate requests that are handled within the Java code embedded in the frontend.

**2. Quiz Handling (Java):**
- Java code processes the requests from the user, such as fetching quiz questions, validating user responses, and updating user progress.
- Quiz questions and user data are stored and managed locally within the application, ensuring that the entire process is handled on the client side.

**3. User Feedback (Frontend):**
- The frontend receives the processed data from the Java code and presents the information to the user through the interface.
